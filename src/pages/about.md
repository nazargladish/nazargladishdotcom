I work at the intersection of software development and technical communication

Currently, I’m exploring things, and actively looking for a new full-time opportunity, ideally at a fast-growing startup ([email me](mailto:hi@nazargladish.com))

Previously, I worked at Gumroad

Before that, I worked at several other companies, helping to build the future of sales and online collaboration. I landed my first job at 18 after applying to 500 positions, and broke into tech on my own in half a year

I’ve also built several products independently, and contributed to open-source software
